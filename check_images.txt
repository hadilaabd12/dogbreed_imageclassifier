Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes -- all models classified Dog_01.jpg to be a golden retriever.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Both AlexNet and VGG classified Dog_01 and Dog_02 to be the same breed of golden retriever. However, ResNet classified them to be different breeds (classified Dog_02 as "cocker spaniel, english cocker spaniel, cocker")


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: AlexNet detected the object picture to not be a dog but failed to classify the animal. ResNet classified the object picture well but failed to classify the animal picture to be a non match -- same for VGG.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: According to the answers, I believe that the VGG arch did best. For once, the stats show a pct match of 75% for it with all the other stats at 100%.
